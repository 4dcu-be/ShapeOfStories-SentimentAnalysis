# ShapeOfStories-SentimentAnalysis


Trying to find Kurt Vonnegut's "Shape" of a Story using natural language processing and sentiment analysis. This code
goes along with [this post](http://blog.4dcu.be/programming/2019/12/01/Sentiment-Analysis.html) on my 
[blog](http://blog.4dcu.be/).

The easiest way to run this is to install Anaconda, it has all packages required to run this notebook. From an
Anaconda prompt run the commands below to clone the repository and start a notebook

```bash
git clone https://github.com/4dcu-be/ShapeOfStories-SentimentAnalysis
cd ShapeOfStories-SentimentAnalysis
jupyter notebook
```

Your browser will open (or open it yourself and head to [localhost:8888](localhost:8888)) and open the notebook.
